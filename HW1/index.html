                ranks the sponsors by sponsorship size. There are only 3 colors in the graph: orange, black and grey.
                Even better, the Nike logo is at the center of the graph.

                This is a <font color="#73AD21"><b>GOOD</b></font> visualization because it has very few color, few words, but
                has powerful information. The small figures also visually illustrate what sports it sponsored.The only
                two
                important numbers are big and obvious.

            <li>The author tries to convey that Nike's has sponsored not only a large amount of money in sports, but
                also
                in various number of sports. The message is concise and powerful.

                There are two colors in the graph: black and white. Each data point represents on infection. The lighter
                the graph the more frequent the infection happens.

            <li>The author wants to illustrate all the data on customer support activities on

                the author either to use a few charts with linkages or to use a interactive chart. Less color and less
                data points will tell a better story.
